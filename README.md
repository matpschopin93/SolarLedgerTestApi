# SolarLedgerTestApi

Hi,
I created a spring boot app that can it be started with : 

mvn spring-boot:run

and builded with :
mvn clean install

The api doesnt't handle the concorrency, but i tried to use Java Stream as request.

I hope it will like you.

In the folder test/resource there are some examples of request Body in Json Format used by JunitTest.

I used a mySqlWorkbeanch DBMS and Java 11, I prefered to sort alphabetically using the query because is more efficiently than Java function.

Best Regards

Matteo
